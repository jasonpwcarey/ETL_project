The purpose of this study was to create a database of clinical trials over the past five years that lead to FDA approval of drugs. The purpose of the database will be to reference specific drugs and determine when they got FDA approval and the associated clinical trials that lead to that approval.

Data Sources: Two data Sources were downloaded from a The FDA â€“ List of FDA approved drugs
 and clinical trials.gov.
